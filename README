pdf2epl:
What does it do: converts VERY SIMPLE pdf files into EPL format for Zebra label printers. Text handling is messy and probably won't work.
Status: works for me (+hardcoded printer and paper parameters) (+messy code)
Planned: bilevel image support.

pdf2eplimage:
What does it do: converts pdf to EPL commands with inline image printing. Uses ImageMagick to convert pdf into bilevel pbm file.
Status: works just fine.
